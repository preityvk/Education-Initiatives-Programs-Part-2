Step-by-Step Guide to the Virtual Classroom Manager Program

1. Collections and Imports
To utilize different utility classes like `Set`, `List{, `Map}, {HashSet{, `ArrayList}, and `HashMap{, the program first imports `java.util.*}. The classroom data, including students, assignments, and submissions, are managed using these data structures.

2. Inner Class (Classroom)
The `Classroom` class is a representation of a virtual classroom that contains all pertinent data, including students, assignments, and their responses. The essential components are as follows:
- Features:
  - {name}: A {String} that serves as the name of the classroom. A {Set<String>} containing distinct student IDs is called `students}. No student may be added more than once thanks to a {Set}.
  - {assignments}: A {List<String>} containing the list of tasks assigned to students in class.
  - {submissions}: A {Map<String, Set<String>>} called `submissions} keeps track of which students have turned in which assignments. Every student ID corresponds to a {Set} of tasks that they have turned in.

- Constructor: This function creates blank data structures for students, assignments, and submissions and initializes a classroom with its name.
Key Methods: 
  - {addStudent}: Initializes a new student's submission record and adds them to the classroom.
  - {scheduleAssignment}: Appends a new task to the classroom's existing list of assignments.
  - {submitAssignment}: Ensures that only enrolled students may submit by keeping track of a student's submission for a particular assignment.
  - {getStudents}: Provides the classroom's set of students back.
  - {getSubmissions`: Provides a map showing the assignments that students have turned in.

3. Manager Class for Virtual Classrooms
This course offers ways to communicate with other classes and oversees some of them.
Features:
  - {classrooms}: A {Map<String, Classroom>} with the classroom name serving as the key that contains all of the classrooms.
Constructor: The constructor creates a blank `HashMap} to hold the classroom data.
Key Methods: 
  - {addClassroom}: Adds a new classroom if one does not already exist with the same name.
  - {addStudent}: Allocates a new pupil to a designated classroom.
  - {scheduleAssignment}: Arranges a fresh task for a certain classroom.
  - {submitAssignment}: Permits a pupil to turn in an assignment to a particular class.
  - {listStudentsInClass}: Shows the full list of students registered in a particular classroom, together with their completed assignments and contributions.

4. Main Method:
The program's entry point, the `main` method, collects user input via a `Scanner`. A loop takes orders from the user and executes them repeatedly.
Command Handling: After dividing user input into command portions, the software handles the command portions according to the kind of command (e.g., creating a classroom, enrolling students). It enables the user to manage students, assignments, and classes interactively.
